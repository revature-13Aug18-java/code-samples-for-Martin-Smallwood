# README

This is a part of a full-stack application that I worked on with a team of 2 other people. I was in charge of creating the back-end database interaction by implementing Spring Boot. There are various endpoints that the front-end can use to do any of the CRUD operations that are required.

A user should be able to login/register.
A user should be able to add to their own preferences.
A user should be able to view other users.
A user should be able to match with other users.
