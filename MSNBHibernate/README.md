# README

This is a part of a full-stack application that I worked on with a team of 2 other people. I was in charge of creating the back-end database interaction by implementing Spring Boot. There are various endpoints that the front-end can use to do any of the CRUD operations that are required. The concept behind this project was to make an online dating service that used musical preferences as the basis of matching users.

A user should be able to login/register.
A user should be able to add to their own preferences.
A user should be able to view other users.
A user should be able to match with other users.
