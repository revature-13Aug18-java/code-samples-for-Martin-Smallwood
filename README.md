Included here are projects 0-2.

# Project 0
This is a mock bank app utilizing JDBC and core java.

# Project 1
This is a mock reimbursement app. It is also my first full-stack application utilizing JDBC, Servlets, HTML, CSS, JS and Java.

# MBSN
This is the first sprint of a dating app matching people based on their musical preferences. I was in charge of the back-end, working with Spring Boot to provide database interaction to the front-end which is based in Angular.

# Project 3
These are the files that I have worked on within the Rideshare application. The Rideshare application functionality includes aiding users in finding carpool arrangements based on physical location. There are driver and rider roles for the regular user and Trainer and Admin roles for people of authority. We have registration key functionality to ensure that those who register are only from Revature. I mostly dealt with editing views for mobile devices. In addition, my initial time was spent creating the initial tests and test set up. I also eliminated my fair share of bugs/exploits.
