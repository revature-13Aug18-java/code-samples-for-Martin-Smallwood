# Command Line Banking App
This was my first foray into creating a java application that could interact with a database. I used Java, JDBC, SQL, and the DAO design pattern.
A user is able to either login or create a new account. Upon logging in, they are able to deposit, withdraw, view balance, and logout via command line input.
A user is not able to withdraw more than they have in the account.
